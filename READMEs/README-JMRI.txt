How to set up JMRI in order to run the trains

1. Start Decoder pro in the directory path: ~/desktop/JMRI/DecoderPro (Start DecoderPro first instead of going straight to Panel Pro because if you go straight to Panel Pro sometimes the program runs into problems with the serial ports. Also having Decoder Pro open provides easy access to shutting the power to the track off if something goes wrong)
2. Click on File -> Open PanelPro Window
3. Start the TrainLocationFinal.py program in the terminal
4. In Panel Pro, click Panels -> Run Script... -> ScriptPowerAndFile.py (You will have to go to the directory containing ScriptPowerAndFile.py)
5. It may take a few moments for the trains to start up when the program is first run (up to a minute), but starts up faster in proceeding runs.
