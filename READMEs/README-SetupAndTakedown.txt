Steps for setup:
1. Set down the board on the wooden blocks, two blocks on each corner of the board (preferably not under any wires)
2. Put the GE Logo light back on the board and re-connect it to the breadboard (The wire colors match)
3. Plug in the Box power supply and reconnect it to the breadboards if it was disconnected
4. Plug in the HDMI cord to the raspberry pi
5. Plug in the power for the Raspberry Pi and turn the Pi on.
6. WAIT FOR THE PI TO TURN ON AND THE RELAY INITIALIZE SCRIPT TO FINISH (All of the relays should go off one at a time and then they should all be off). You will be ready when you see the desktop of the pi
7. Plug in the SPROG power supply, and reattach power cord to SPROG
8. Plug in and connect the turnout power supply

Steps for take down:
1. Stop the train program and shut off JRMI
2. Shutdown the Raspberry Pi
3. Unplug the Raspberry pi and pull the power cord through the large hole in the board.
4. Unplug the SPROG power cord, disconnect the SPROG power cord from the SPROG, and pull cord through the large hole in the board
5. Unplug the HDMI cord from the Raspberry PI and pull it through the large hold in the board
6. Unplug the Box power supply for the beam breakers and relays
7. Unplug the turnout power supply, and disconnect the power supply from the board (using the connection that is in the middle of that wire)
8. Disconnect the GE Logo light from the breadboard and take GE Logo light and stand off of the board
9. Take the trains off of the board.
10. Make sure that the Raspberry Pi, breadboards, and train tracks are secured to the board
11. Make sure that the Box is secured to the bottom of the board in some fashion, or disconnect the Box wires from the breadboards on top and pull the wires out.
12. Move the board. Usually takes two or more people to carry the board as well as the blocks that the board sits on
